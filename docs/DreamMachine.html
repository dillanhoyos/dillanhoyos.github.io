        <h2>Orbz</h2>
        <p>Orbz is a thrilling aim trainer game that puts your skills to the test! Players are tasked with tapping objects of the correct color combination to rack up those high scores. As a technical audio implementer, I had the exciting job of bringing the sound design to life in this game. Using Wwise and Unity, I created audio reactive objects that would pulse with excitement as you hit your target. The result was an audio experience that was not only immersive but also added an extra layer of challenge to the game. Every time you hit an object with the correct color combination, you would hear a satisfying "ping!" and be one step closer to mastering the game.</p>
